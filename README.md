As applications get more and more complex, clients demand faster interaction. They want to receive a post, a notice, an event as soon as it happens. They want to know if a friend is online or offline in a chat application as soon as the other party changes their status. They want to know these things as soon as they happen, in other words, in Real-Time.

Implementing real time systems can be very costly, complicated, and time consuming. This is where Firebase comes into play to save the day.

Firebase starts with a FREE tier that can be used even in your commercial applications. It also comes with a very simple to use API that can be use for iOS (including Swift), Android, and JavaScript so you don't have to worry about compatibility. It also comes with a very easy to use dashboard web interface.
